Program for 80C51 microcontroller is used for traffic control on the simple crossroad.

The traffic lights work in two main modes:

1. Vertical direction (cars): cars can only drive through crossroad forward or turn right & walkers can only go in horizontal direction 2. Horizontal direction (cars): cars can only drive through crossroad forward or turn right & walkers can only go in vertical direction.

Table of states (states of switching the traffic lights) are shown in source code comments.
